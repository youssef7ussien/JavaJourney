## Introduction

Start by learning how to add object instances to the Spring context. These object instances name **'beans'**.
Spring have multiple ways to add beans in the context that can manage them and plug features it provides into
your app. Can add beans in the context in the following ways:

1. [Using the **`@Bean`** annotation](#bean-annotation)
2. [Using **stereotype** annotation](#stereotype-annotation)
3. [**Programmatically**](#programmatically)

> We only add the instances that Spring needs to manage. In a practical scenario, not all objects need to be
> added to the Spring context.

## `@Bean` annotation

Adding an object instance to the Spring context using the `@Bean` annotation. You need to follow these steps
to do that:

1. Define a configuration class (annotated with `@Configuration`) for your project, we use to configure the
   context of Spring.
2. Add a method to the configuration class that returns the object instance you want to add to the context and
   annotate the method with the `@Bean` annotation.
3. Make spring use the configuration class defined in step 1.

```java
public class Parrot {
    private String name;
    // Omitted getters and setters
}

...

// Define configuration class
@Configuration /* Use @Configuration annotation to define this class as a Spring configuration class */
public class ProjectConfig {
    @Bean
    public Parrot parrot() {
        var p = new Parrot();
        p.setName("Miki");

        return p; /* Spring Adds to its context the Parrot instance return by the method. */
    }
}

...

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* when creating the Spring context instance, send the configuration class as a parameter to instruct
        Spring to use it. */
        var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        /* Gets a reference of a bean of type Parrot from the Spring context */
        Parrot p = context.getBean(Parrot.class);
        /* You don't need to do any explicit casting. Spring looks for a bean of the type you requested in its
        context. If such a bean doesn't exist, Spring will throw an exception. */

        System.out.println(p.getname()); /* output: Miki */
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `@Bean` annotation to return type of any object (such `String`, `Integer`, ...etc)

### Use `@Bean` annotation with more than one object of the same type

You can declare as many instances of the same type as you wish by simply declaring more methods annotated with
the `@Bean` annotation.

```java
@Configuration 
public class ProjectConfig {
    @Bean
    public Parrot parrot1() {
        ...
        return p; 
    }
    
    @Bean
    public Parrot parrot2() {
        ...
        return p; 
    }

    @Bean
    public Parrot parrot3() {
        ...
        return p; 
    }
}
```

After declaring multiple methods with the same return type you can't get the beans from the context anymore by
only specifying the type. If you do, you'll get an exception because Spring cannot determine which instance
you've declared you are referring to. To solve this ambiguity problem, you need to refer to one of the
instances precisely by using the **bean's name**.

- **bean's name**: Spring by default uses the names of the methods annotated with @Bean as the beans' names
themselves

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);
        
        /* First parameter is the name of the instance to which we refer. */
        Parrot p = context.getBean("parrot2", Parrot.class);
    }
}
```

If you'd like to give another name to the bean, you can use either one the name or the value attributes of the
`@Bean` annotation. Any of the following syntax will change the name of the bean:

- `@Bean(name = "newName")`
- `@Bean(value = "newName")`
- `@Bean("newName")`

```java
...
@Bean(name = "Miki")
public Parrot parrot2() {
    ...
    return p; 
}
...
```

Finally, when you have multiple beans of the same kind in the Spring context you can make one of them
***primary***. You mark the bean you want to be primary using the **`@Primary`** annotation.

A **primary bean** is the one Spring will choose if it has multiple options and you don't specify name.

```java

@Bean
@Primary
public Parrot parrot2() {
    ...
    return p; 
}
```

## Stereotype annotation

To create **stereotype** annotation instance, simply add the annotation above the **class** that needs to be
instantiated in the Spring context.

When the Spring context is created, an instance of the annotated class is automatically created and added to
the context. Spring provides several stereotype annotations, including the `@Component`, which is the basic
one. Follow this steps to create a **stereotype** instance:

1. Using the `@Component` annotation, mark the classes for which you want Spring to add to context.
2. Using `@ComponentScan` annotation over the configuration class, instruct Spring on where to find the
   classes you marked.

```java
@Component /* instruct Spring to create an instance of this class and add it to its context. */
public class Parrot {
    private String name;
    // Omitted getters and setters
}

...

@Configuration 
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "main") /* Using the basePackages attribute of the annotation, we tell Spring
                                        where to look for classes annotated with stereotype annotation. */
public class ProjectConfig {

}

...

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Parrot p = context.getBean(Parrot.class);

        System.out.println(p);

        System.out.println(p.getName()); /* Prints null because we did not assign any name to the parrot
                                            instance */ 
    }
}
```

From previous snippet, The second value printed is `null` because we did not assign any name to this parrot.
Spring only creates an instance of the class, leaving the task of assigning a name to the user.

In real-world scenarios, It is recommended to use **stereotype** annotations as much as possible (because this
approach implies writing less code). Use the `@Bean` annotation only when you cannot add the bean otherwise
(such as when creating a bean for a class that is part of a library and cannot be modified to add the
stereotype annotation.)

## Programmatically

Spring 5 supports for functional bean registration in the application context, which offers great flexibility
because it enables adding new instances in the context directly by calling a method of the context instance.
This approach is useful when implementing a custom way of adding beans to the context and the `@Bean` or the
**stereotype** annotations insufficient.

Using `@Bean` and **stereotype** annotations can implement most scenarios. However, if you need to add a
specific bean to the Spring context based on custom logic. The previous methods cannot do this so you need to
explore other options. In such cases, a programmatic approach like following snippet can be implemented.

```java
if (condition)
    registerBean(b1); // if condition is true, create b1 instance.
else
    registerBean(b1); // if condition is false, create b2 instance.
```

To add a bean to the Spring context using a programmatically approach, simply call the `registerBean()` method
of the `ApplicationContext` instance. This method takes four parameters, as presented in the following code:

```java
<T> void registerBean(
    String beanName,
    Class<T> beanClass,
    Supplier<T> supplier,
    BeanDefinitionCustomizer... customizer);
```

1. **beanName**: Define a name for the bean you add in the Spring context. (can set `null` to make bean
   without name).
2. **beanClass**: Define the bean you add to the context. (Such class `Parrot`; the value you give to this
   parameter is `Parrot.class`).
3. **Supplier**: The implementation of this `Supplier` needs to return the value of the instance you add to
   the context. (`Supplier` is a function interface that return a value without taking a parameters).
4. **BeanDefinitionCustomizer**: It is just an interface that implement to configure different characteristics
   of the bean (e.g., making it primary). Being defined as a **varargs type**, can omit this parameter
   entirely, or can it more values of type `BeanDefinitionCustomizer`.

```java
public class Parrot {
    private String name;
    // Omitted getters and setters
}

...

@Configuration 
public class ProjectConfig {

}

...

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ProjectConfig.class);

        Parrot p = new Parrot();
        p.setName("Miki");
        
        Supplier<Parrot> parrotSupplier = () -> p; /* define supplier to return this instance. */

        /* call the registerBean() method to add the instance to the Spring context */
        context.registerBean("parrot1", Parrot.class, parrotSupplier);

        System.out.println(p.getName()); /* output: Miki */ 
    }
}
```
