# Spring in the real world

The Spring framework is an application framework that is part of the Java ecosystem. An application framework
is a set of common software functionalities that provides a foundation structure for developing an
application. An application framework eases the effort of writing an application by taking out the effort of
writing all the program code from scratch.

## Why should we use frameworks?

When the software development domain extended, and more and more applications
started to be published on the market, it became easier to observe that many of these
apps had similar requirements. Letâ€™s name a few of them:

- **Logging**: Error, warning, and informational messages form an indispensable component of virtually every
application, facilitating robust monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Transactions**: Nearly all applications leverage transactions to ensure the integrity and consistency of
data operations.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Most applications use protection mechanisms against the same common
vulnerabilities.
- **Communication**: Most applications use similar ways to communicate with each other.
- **Performance Optimization**: Most applications use similar mechanisms to improve their performance, like
caching or data compression.

## The Spring ecosystem

Spring is an ecosystem of frameworks. The Spring ecosystem refers to a collection of interrelated projects
built on top of the core Spring Framework. These projects address various aspects of Java application
development, aiming to simplify tasks and provide a cohesive development experience.

### The purpose of using the Spring

- ***Reduced Boilerplate Code***: Spring projects streamline development by eliminating the need to write repetitive
code for common tasks like dependency injection, configuration, and data access.
- ***Improved Developer Productivity***: With Spring, developers can focus on the core business logic of their
applications rather than low-level details.
- ***Modular and Flexible***: You can choose individual Spring projects based on your specific application
requirements, allowing for a tailored development approach.

### Key Spring Projects

- ***Spring Core***: The foundation of the Spring framework, provides the essential building blocks for
dependency injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
- ***Spring Boot***: Simplifies application setup and configuration, enabling rapid development of microservices
and standalone applications.
- ***Spring MVC***: Supports building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural
pattern.
- ***Spring Data***: Offers abstractions for interacting with various databases (relational, NoSQL, etc.),
simplifying data access logic.
- Spring Security: Provides comprehensive security features for authentication, authorization, and access
control.
- ***Spring Cloud***: Facilitates the development of cloud-native applications with features for service discovery,
configuration management, and distributed tracing.

## Spring Core

Spring Core establishes the foundation for the Spring Framework by introducing the principles of dependency
injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC). These principles significantly enhance the testability,
maintainability, and overall flexibility within Java applications. One of these features is the Spring
context.

### Spring Context

The Spring context is a fundamental capability of the Spring framework that enables Spring to manage instances
of your app. Imagine the context as a place in the memory of your app in which we add all the object instances
that we want the framework to manage. By default Spring doesn't know any of the objects you define in your
application. To enable Spring to see your objects, you need to add them to the context.

### Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI)

In the software development, particularly within the Spring Framework, Inversion of Control (IoC) and
Dependency Injection (DI) are fundamental concepts that work hand-in-hand to promote well-structured and
maintainable applications. IoC provides the overall framework for managing object lifecycles and dependencies.
DI is a specific technique used within the IoC paradigm to handle how objects acquire their dependencies. The
IoC container, with its control over object creation, is the ideal entity to inject dependencies into objects.

#### Inversion of Control (IoC)

IoC dictates a shift in how applications manage object lifecycles and dependencies. Traditionally,
applications directly control object creation and destruction. IoC flips this notion, transferring control to
an external entity, often an IoC container.

##### Benefits

- ***Centralized Control***: Object creation, configuration, and destruction are centralized in the IoC container,
leading to improved maintainability and reduced boilerplate code.
- ***Flexibility***: The IoC container allows for configuration of object lifecycles and dependencies, enabling
adaptation to changing requirements.
- ***Improved Testability***: Objects become easier to test in isolation as the IoC container manages their
lifecycle and dependencies.
- ***Spring Implementation***: Spring Core acts as the IoC container within the Spring Framework. You define beans
(objects) with their properties, dependencies, and potentially lifecycle methods in configuration files or
annotations. Spring Core then manages the bean lifecycle.

#### Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental software design pattern that plays a critical role in the Spring
Framework and other modern development frameworks. It's essentially about how objects get the dependencies
(other objects that depend on them) they need to function. Spring Core heavily utilizes DI principles. You
define beans and their dependencies in configuration, and Spring Core injects them into the beans during
object creation.

##### Without Dependency Injection (Traditional Approach)

Objects are responsible for creating and managing their own dependencies. This Leads to:

- Hardcoding dependency classes within the object's code.
- Manually instantiating these dependencies during object creation.

###### Drawbacks Traditional Approach

- ***Tight Coupling***: Objects become tightly coupled to specific implementations of their dependencies. This makes
code:
  - **Less flexible**: Changes to a dependency might ripple through the entire application.
  - More difficult to test: Unit testing becomes challenging as dependencies are not easily mocked or
  replaced.
  - **Less maintainable**: Code complexity increases due to tight coupling and potential for errors.

##### Dependency Injection in Action

Instead of objects creating their own dependencies, these dependencies are injected into them during object creation.
This can be achieved through various mechanisms:

- ***Constructor Injection***: Dependencies are passed as arguments to the object's constructor.
- ***Setter Injection***: Dependencies are injected through setter methods within the object.
- ***Field Injection (Less Common)***: Dependencies are directly injected into object fields.

###### Benefits of Dependency Injection

- ***Loose Coupling***: Objects are less reliant on specific implementations, promoting:
  - **Modularity**: Code becomes more modular as objects can be reused in different contexts with different
    dependencies.
  - **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced with test doubles for efficient unit testing.
  - **Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand and modify.
- ***Improved Code Readability***: Explicitly declaring dependencies in constructor arguments or setter methods
enhances code clarity.
- ***Flexibility***: The ability to inject different implementations of the same dependency allows for easier
adaptation to changing requirements.
